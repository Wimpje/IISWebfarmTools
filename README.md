# IISWebfarmTools
Some tools to create better monitoring for IIS webfarms with Application Request Routing

# Purpose
I created a wrapper around webfarms with the Microsoft.Web.Management.dll since I couldn't get stable results from the ApplicationRequestRouting WMI class. Also learning how performance counters work etc etc.
